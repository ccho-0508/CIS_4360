Twitter was initially known as “The Monorail” and it was one of the largest Ruby on Rails deployments. At its peak, the application could service 3283 tweets per second (TPS) which was 5 times the average rate. The issue with this was the unpredictability of events that would cause a spike in TPS. Whenever viral events would happen, the Monorail would go down, marking it as unreliable and unproductive. The next step was adapting the application to adhere to a service oriented architecture, specifically by using microservices. By re-architecting the stack, there were many benefits such as fault tolerance, isolated teams, scalable and efficient services, and increased developer productivity.

I had a good understanding of these benefits thanks to the readings and labs from class, but the challenges that inspired Twitter’s chargeback system were very unique problems I hadn’t thought of. The “Innovation Insight for Microservices” paper from Gartner provides a list of the different costs of implementing a microservices architecture. Two of them are:

- “Data management — Microservices patterns fundamentally change how data is managed within an application, which impacts data governance, reporting and analytics practices.” 
- “Product mindset — MSA requires a product mindset, which is an organizational change that affects budgeting, staffing and planning outside of IT. It impacts funding models, roles and responsibilities, development team structures, and corporate communication structures”. 
The breakdown of the challenge into the four categories, identifying services, cataloging resources, metering and chargebacks, and service metadata, gave context to these costs listed, and it was interesting to see how these issues were resolved and combined to create the chargeback system. Although Twitter has switched from Mesos to Kubernetes, Mesos was an integral part of the infrastructure as its orchestration system for scheduling and managing clusters. The chargeback system was built on Mesos, so it could track its containers/services. For the case study I would look further into Mesos to understand how it works in comparison to Kubernetes.
